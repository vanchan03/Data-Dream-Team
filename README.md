Hello!
This is the repository for my experience at DataFest 2024, along with fellow UCLA students Kelly Vu, Angelo Desiderio, Ryan Largo, and Daniel Yeo. 
As the most experienced member on my team in statistics and data science, I took the lead role in cleaning the large dataset using the key data cleaning library DPLYR, and machine learning applications.
Attached in this repository is our data cleaning, our RandomForest model, and our final presentation. Thank you!
